# Introduction
- Research Question - What is the correlation between different groups of people and scoring 5 or above in GCSE English and maths?

class: inverse, center, middle

# Variables 

---

# Variable that will use

- Ethnicity

- Gender

- FSM

- SEN_type

- SEN_grouping

- Religious_denominated

- Value

# Code

```{r boring-analysis}
# a boring analysis
national %>%
  select(Value, Ethnicity, School_characteristic) %>%
  filter(Value != "!") %>%
  glimpse()

```

# Plots

```{r recode-species, echo = FALSE}
# In this chunk I'm doing a bunch of analysis that I don't want to present 
# in my slides. But I need the resulting data frame for a plot I want to present.
    ggplot(national, mapping = aes(x = School_characteristic, fill = Ethnicity)) +
    geom_bar()+
    coord_flip()+
theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
        legend.direction = "horizontal", legend.position = "bottom")

```

## Plot and text

.pull-left[
- The bar plot shows that, in each school sample, there are nearly equal numbers of each ethnicity, except for the “All” category, which is particularly large. So we can take a random sample of ethnicities and compare them, and they're relatively fair.
When Asian is filtered, the percentage of Asians who scored more than five was different in each kind of schools, with some schools having a particularly high percentage and others having a particularly low percentage. 

- When we pulled a random sample of ethnicities, such as Black, White, and others, the point plot showed that the percentage of people got fives concentrated at a higher value in "state-varied mainstream" than in any other kind of school. In a school of the "all-state-varied," the proportion of people who get a five is lower than in other schools.

.pull-right[
```{r warning=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.width=4, echo=FALSE}
# see how I changed out.width and fig.width from defaults
# to make the figure bigger
    national %>%
    filter(Ethnicity == "Asian", Value != "!") %>%
    ggplot(mapping = aes(x = School_characteristic, y = Value)) +
    geom_point() +
    coord_flip()
